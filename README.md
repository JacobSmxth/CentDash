## **Installation**

Clone the repository and run the application:

cd CentLedger
./gradlew :app:bootRun
```

The API will start on `http://localhost:8080` by default.

## **Usage**

### Adding Transactions
```bash
# Add an income
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/entries \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"type": "INCOME", "desc": "Salary", "cents": 500000}'

# Add an expense
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/entries \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"type": "EXPENSE", "desc": "Groceries", "cents": 7500}'
```

### Managing Budgets
```bash
# Create a budget
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/budgets \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"desc": "Monthly Food Budget", "current": 0, "max": 50000}'

# Get all budgets
curl http://localhost:8080/api/budgets
```

## **API Endpoints**

All endpoints return proper HTTP status codes and location headers for created resources. Entries and budgets are identified by UUIDs for reliable referencing.
